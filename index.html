  <h1>The exact blueprint to go from $0 to $1 million</h1>

  <ol>
    <li>Get a job/ start a business that pays you more than you spend per month.</li>
    <li>Save the excess every month.</li>
    <li>While doing the above, learn how to trade for cheap (first year). Backtesting then dollar trading. Build
      systems. Understand your strengths and weaknesses. Find some that works.</li>
    <li>Keep working/ business full time. Trade part time (as many hours as possible without affecting your job/ ability
      to earn).</li>
    <li>Learn how to scale your trading. Go from $1 risk &gt; $2 &gt; $5 &gt; $10.</li>
    <li>After you make <strong>6 months</strong> of consistent profits at these small stakes, start to trade with the
      money you have saved each month. Example: if you saved $10,000, start trading $1-200 risk (1-2%) per trade.</li>
  </ol>

  <p><strong>CONTINUE WORKING at this time.</strong></p>

  <ol start="7">
    <li>After you save up to $50,000 AND have demonstrated further consistent profits from your trading, go full time if
      you so wish.</li>
  </ol>

  <p>Even at this stage, I wouldn't go full time. I would continue to do a part time job a few hours per day to pay the
    bills so that you don't have to ever touch the trading capital. Compounding is magic, protect your portfolio. Can
    work 4 hours a day and trade 8.</p>

  <p>How long will this take? Probably 2 years to get to #7 (how fast you save $50,000 will vary).</p>

  <p>Then you aim to make 100% per year.</p>

  <ul>
    <li>+1 year: $100,000</li>
    <li>2: $200,000</li>
    <li>3: $400,000</li>
    <li>4: $800,000+</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Millionaire in 6 years total from Zero. Quite a bit faster is also possible with a combination of skill/ hard work/
    and good fortune.</p>

  <p>There's the blueprint.</p>

  <p>Now get to work.</p>
